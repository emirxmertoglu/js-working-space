# My JavaScript Working Space and Notes

```js
typeof variable // returns the type of variable

/_ comment line _/ // returns the same comment line

number ** 2 // returns the square a number

// Ctrl + L clear the console

var name = "emir"
name[0] = "a" // we expect the first character of the name variable to be changed with "a" character, but the contents of primitive variables cannot be changed
```
